1. file()和open()的区别
open(name[, mode[, buffering]]) 
open a file, returning an object of the file type. When opening a file, it's preferable to use open() instead of invoking
the file constructor directly.

file(name[, mode[, buffering]])
constructor function for the file type.



注：文件对象是可迭代的，可以直接在for循环中对他们进行操作

with open('test.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        print line
